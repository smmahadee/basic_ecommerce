Hishabee Ecommerce
This is a mini ecommerce project. While the task itself was simple, I took the opportunity to structure and customize the codebase as if it were a larger project. The project is built using Next.js and utilizes various libraries and tools for state management, UI, and more.

Getting Started
To run the development server, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Install dependencies using one of the following commands:
npm install or yarn or pnpm install

Start the development server:
npm run dev or yarn dev  or pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the project.

You can begin editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page will automatically update as you make changes to the file.

## Features and Dependencies

The project includes the following features and dependencies:

- State management using Redux Toolkit
- API requests using Axios
- UI components using Tailwind CSS
- React icons from `react-icons`
- Data fetching with React Query
